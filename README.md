# STM32-Python-Integrated-Real-Time-Tracking-System

Real-Time Embedded Tracking and Control System with Vision-Aided Coordinate Computation

### 1. Project Description  

This project implements a real-time tracking and control system based on the STM32F407 microcontroller.
The firmware runs on the STM32 board and communicates with a Python host program through serial communication.
The host computer performs visualization, data processing, and control commands.

### 3. File Explanations  

PCTrace_python/: 
- PCTraceM.py : Main Python program for communication, data processing, and visualization.
- readdata.py : Utility for reading and plotting recorded data.
- data/ :  folder for storing raw data files.

STM32F407_Firmware/:
- USER/main.c : Main firmware program. Includes initialization, sensor reading, PWM control, and serial communication.
- USER/global.c : Global variables and helper functions used across modules.
- USER/global.h : Header file declaring shared structures and functions.
- Peripheral Configuration Description.txt : Describes hardware connections (timers, UART pins, power supply).
- Communication Byte Table.xlsx : Lists serial communication formats and byte definitions

### 4. Files and Folders Removed  

The following folders are not included in this repository because they exist in official STM32 or ALIENTEK libraries or are automatically generated files.

Removed folders:
- CORE/ : ARM CMSIS core files provided by ST.
- FWLIB/ : STM32 standard peripheral library.
- SYSTEM/ : System initialization files (clock configuration, NVIC setup).
- HARDWARE/ : ALIENTEK board driver examples (KEY, LED, TIMER, etc.).
- OBJ/ : Temporary build output files generated by Keil.
- USER/DebugConfig/, .dbgconf, .uvprojx, .uvoptx, keilkilll.bat : Debug and project configuration files.

These files are automatically created by the IDE and do not contain custom logic.

### 5. How to Run  

Hardware Requirements:
- STM32F407ZGT6 (ALIENTEK board)
- Ultrasonic sensors and servo motors connected according to Peripheral Configuration Description.txt
- USB or UART link between the STM32 board and a computer

Firmware:
- Open the STM32 project in Keil μVision or STM32CubeIDE.
- Compile and flash the code in USER/main.c and USER/global.c to the STM32 board.
- Confirm UART connection at 115200 bps.

Python Host Program:
- Install Python 3.10 or newer.
- Install dependencies:
   pip install opencv-python numpy matplotlib
- Run the host program:
   python PCTraceM.py
- Optional: use readdata.py to visualize the stored data.

### 6. Notes  

- Only USER code and configuration files are included in this repository.
  All standard STM32 and ALIENTEK library files are excluded for clarity.
- The provided firmware and Python scripts are sufficient to demonstrate the full control and data acquisition process.

### 7. Languages:  

C (Keil), Python
